# Request Header Parser Microservice

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/request-header-parser-microservice).

## Functionality

This is the [request header parser microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice) project, where I make a simple API that returns simple header information in a JSON format.

## Thoughts

Very simple API. All the necessary information was in the request, and it was just a matter of finding it and returning it as JSON.

God bless.
